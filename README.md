# How's the Weather

This is a Python application that uses the Tkinter library to create a graphical user interface (GUI) for displaying weather information based on user input. The application allows users to enter a location (city, state, and optionally a country) to retrieve current weather data for that location. The weather data is obtained from the OpenWeatherMap API. The application also displays weather icons corresponding to the current weather condition.

## Prerequisites

Before you can use this application, you need to set up your environment and obtain an API key from OpenWeatherMap. Follow these steps to get started:

1. **Python**: Make sure you have Python 3.x installed on your system.

2. **Required Libraries**: Install the necessary Python libraries using `pip`:

3. **API Key**: You need an API key from OpenWeatherMap to access weather data. Create a free account on the OpenWeatherMap website and generate an API key.

4. **Environment Variables**: Create a `.env` file in the same directory as your script and add your OpenWeatherMap API key to it. 


## Usage

1. Run the application by executing the script. A GUI window will appear.

```bash
python your_script_name.py
